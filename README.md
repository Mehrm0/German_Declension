# German_Declension
A  c++ repository for exercising German declension.
This is a repository to make c++ code for exercising German declension. For everyone who wants to learn German as a foreign language, declension is probably the most difficult subject. I created this code to do as much exercise as possible to strengthen my German grammar. The first section is the declension of adjectives without article(type 2). I'll add other sections gradually. `Gcc version 9.3.0 (Ubuntu 9.3.0-17ubuntu1~20.04)` was used to compile the code.
You can compile it by:  `g++ source_name.cpp destination_name` and then run it by `./destination_name` when the compiled file is in the current directory.
